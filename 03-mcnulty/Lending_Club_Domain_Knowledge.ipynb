    "**Lending Club Info**: Lending Club uses technology to operate a credit marketplace at a lower cost than traditional bank loan programs, passing the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors in the form of solid returns. Borrowers who used a personal loan via Lending Club to consolidate debt or pay off high interest credit cards report in a survey that the interest rate on their loan was an average of 24% lower than they were paying on their outstanding debt or credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit accounts** fall into two categories: amortizing loans and revolving trade lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Amortizing loans** involve a borrower making fixed monthly payments of principal and interest to pay off a debt over a preset period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loans that are in **\"Default\"** are loans for which borrowers have failed to make payments for an extended period of time.  In general, a Note enters Default status when it is *121+*n days past due. \n",
    " \n",
    "A loan becomes **Charged Off** when there is no longer a reasonable expectation of further payments.  Charge Off typically occurs when a loan is *150* days past due (i.e. 30 days after the Default status is reached) and there is no reasonable expectation of sufficient payment to prevent the charge off.  In certain circumstances, loans may be charged off at an earlier or later date.  Please note, loans for which borrowers have filed for bankruptcy may be charged off earlier based on the date of bankruptcy notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charged-Off** A charge-off or chargeoff is the declaration by a creditor (usually a credit card account) that an amount of debt is unlikely to be collected. This occurs when a consumer becomes severely delinquent on a debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **derogatory public record** is a public record that appears on your credit report. These often result from an unpaid bill or financial obligation. Derogatory public records are negative items to have on a report. The appearance of a derogatory public record on your report may cause lenders to deny you credit. Judgments, bankruptcy, foreclosures and tax liens are all examples of derogatory public records. Keep in mind that a non-financial public record, such as voter registration, does not appear on a credit report and isn't considered a derogatory public record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revolving lines** normally have an expiration date, but while they're active, accountholders can use funds as and when they need them. People with revolving lines of credit are normally required to make monthly interest-only payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installment trade accounts** involve agreements you make to pay an account over time. These accounts show your original and current balance on your credit report, as well as the amount you’re required to pay each month. Unless an installment account is new, your current balance should be less than the original balance as long as you’re making payments on time. Examples of common installment accounts include auto loans, mortgages and personal loans from banks or finance companies. (**BF NOTE**: These are the same as amortizing loans, just wanted to include for more detail)\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies that issue **charge accounts** usually assign a specific charge limit to your account, but these accounts differ from a revolving credit account. Charge accounts allow you to use your credit limit to make purchases, but you’re typically required to pay the balance in full by a certain date instead of over an indefinite period. Some charge accounts charge interest immediately on your purchases, while other charge accounts offer zero interest if your pay your balance before the due date. Similar to a revolving account, your credit report shows the credit limit and balance for the charge account, but it might not show a minimum monthly payment amount, as this type of payment isn't a normal charge account feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **collection accounts** are the least attractive trade account on a credit report. Accounts usually go to collection when the company you originally owe has difficulty collecting from you. Companies send accounts to collection agencies that try more aggressively to get payment. Open collections on your report alert future creditors and lenders that other companies have had problems collecting from you, which may indicate there is a risk in extending new trade lines in your name. Your credit report lists an open collection as long as there is a balance for the account. If you pay the account in full or agree to a settlement of the account, the collection account still shows on your report, but it should show as closed and paid or settled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **title loan** is a loan where an asset is required as collateral, popularized due to two key reasons. First, title loans do not consider an applicant's credit rating when determining qualifications, and second, title loans, thanks to looser application requirements, can be approved very quickly for loan amounts of as little as $100. The most common form of a title loan is a car title loan. In this case, potential borrowers are required to own a car outright and sign the title over to an auto loan title company. The loan company will loan up to 25% of the car's total value to the borrower and keep the car's title as collateral in case of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LC Assigned Loan Grades**: Based on each loan application and credit report, every loan is assigned a grade ranging from A1 to G5 with a corresponding interest rate. Each loan grade and its corresponding interest rate is displayed below.\n",

    "**Lending Club Collection Fee** When borrowers miss payments and loans become late, Lending Club uses best practices from the banking industry to bring delinquent loans back to “current” status. Currently, Lending Club charges investors one of the following collection fees, which is deducted from any amount recovered: 1) Up to 35% of the amount recovered if a collection action must be taken with respect to a loan and no litigation is involved, or 2) 30% of hourly attorneys' fees, plus costs, if litigation is involved. Lending Club does not charge a collection fee if no payments are collected, and no collection fee will be charged in excess of the amount recovered.\n",

    "**Initial List Status**: Certain institutional investors have indicated a preference to be able to purchase loans in their entirety to try and obtain legal and accounting treatment specific to their situation. This process would also provide a great borrower experience that can enable “instant” funding.  To accommodate these requests and while insuring that all investors continue to have access to a large number of loans of equal quality, a randomized subset of loans by grade will be available to purchase as a whole loan (i.e. not in $25 increments) only for a brief time period (12 hours), while all other loans will be immediately available for fractional purchase.  If the loans are not purchased as whole loans in the specified time period, they will become available for purchase in the standard, fractional manner.  Some things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "While we anticipate most investors will continue to prefer investing in fractional loans, we will make whole loans available to anyone requesting it by sending an email to investing@lendingclub.com (please put Whole Loan Access Request in the subject line).\n",
    "To reflect the additional option of whole loans, a new data point has been added to the browse notes and historical download file called “initial listing status”.  This data point has two possible settings –“F” for fractional, “W” for whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter on the Browse Notes page for “Initial listing status” will also be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Code 2 loans**: These are loans made to borrowers that do not meet Lending Club’s current credit policy standards. The FICO scores on these borrowers are typically 640-659, below the 660 threshold on Policy Code 1 loans. These loans are made available to select institutional investors who have a great deal of experience with consumer loans in this credit spectrum and with Lending Club. They are only available as whole loans at this time. Lending Club believes that Policy 2 loans could grow to a total of 15% of the total volume over the next 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification**: LendingClub uses a robust loan approval process. The statistical models we utilize consider hundreds of data points when evaluating a borrower's loan application, and occasionally identify applications that need additional confirmation. Two ways we do this are to seek income verification and income source verification. At times, we also conduct random income verification for testing and analysis. Since 2008, we have conducted either income verification or income source verification on 69.6% of issued loans. 1 For income verification, loan applicants may be required to submit documents such as paystubs, W-2 forms, or other tax records that verify the income stated in their loan request. We may also attempt to verify the income or income source of these applicants by electronically checking their income data through a third-party provider. If an applicant fails to provide satisfactory information in response to an income verification request, or if we cannot electronically verify the income of select applicants, we may deny the loan or request additional information from the applicant.\n",
    "We primarily target loans for income verification or income source verification in the following situations:\n",
    "Based on information from the applicant's credit profile or application;\n",
    "We detect conflicting or unusual information in the loan request (for example, the stated income is high relative to the stated job title of the borrower);\n",
    "We suspect a fraudulent loan request;\n",
    "Random selection to test our policies and for statistical analysis."
