# Metis Projects

Over the summer I attended [Metis' Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps "Metis' Bootcamp Page").
Over the course of twelve weeks, we designed and completed four separate projects, each of which incorporated a different area of machine learning. 
I have also written up [blog posts](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/) on each project with visualizations included. 

Each project has its own folder in which is a `README.md` that describes the project and the corresponding code that I used to implement it.
Below is a short description of each project along with links to their respective blog posts.

[**Magic Through Machine Learning: Recommending Hogwarts Houses using NLP Analysis `(05-kojak)`**](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/kojak/): Developed a
Sorting Hat Algorithm through analysis of the Harry Potter book series using Natural Language
Processing and Network Analysis (NLP, Network Analysis)

[**Pitch Perfecting: Unsupervised Learning of Kickstarter Data `(04-fletcher)`**](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/fletcher/): Scraped and analyzed Kickstarter language
to determine pitch clustering with the ultimate goal of creating a language recommender (NLP, Topic
Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction)

[**Cracking the Club's Code : Predicting LendingClub Default Rates `(03-mcnulty)`**](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/mcnulty/): Constructed a Random Forest
classifcation model to predict borrower defaults among LendingClub Data for a Flask web application
(Classification, Databases Structures, Flask, D3)

[**Forecasting Films: Predicting Opening Weekend Success `(02-luther)`**](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/luther/): Designed a Multivariate Regression using
movie production data scraped from IMDB and Box Office Mojo as well as economic and political
indicators to predict opening weekend success (Web Scraping, Regression, Regularization)

[**Data Cleaning and Daily Commuters: Exploratory Analysis of New York Subway Traffic `(01-benson)`**](https://bfitzpa5.github.io/benson/): Wrangled,
explored and analyzed MTA subway data to maximize proximity to technology firms for fundraising street
canvassers (Data Munging, Analysis, Visualization)

Enjoy!
